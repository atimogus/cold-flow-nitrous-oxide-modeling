# cold flow of self pressurized nitrous oxide
modeling cold flow of self pressurized nitrous oxide and desired fuel, made for concentric design of a pressure vessels using SPI injector model
Dataset.csv is cold flow data from Sunride student team https://www.linkedin.com/company/team-sunride/?originalSubdomain=uk

future projects
1. adding dyer injector modeling for more precise resoults
2. adding hot fire test
